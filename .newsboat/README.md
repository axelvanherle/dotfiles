# .newsboat
My newsboat configuration files, with vim binds.

# Install
To install put `urls` and `config` into the `.newsboat` directory located at home.

Or `cd && git clone https://github.com/axelvanherle/.newsboat.git`. Note that this expects there to be no `.newsboat` directory. You can remove the directory by running `cd && rm -rf .newsboat`.

# Binds
This newsboat is setup with vim binds, so it assumes a basic understanging of navigating with these binds. You only need to know what the `jkhl` binds do to be able to navigate. Also, `g/G` replace `gg and G`.

As far as custom binds i have a few set:
- `a` to toggle the read status of an article
- `N` to toggle downloads in podboat
- `f` follow link
- switch `o` and `O` binds
